First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2015

Name: Ankit Kayastha

Date started: August 30, 2015

Date finished: September 4, 2015

Hours worked: 15-20

Resources used: JavaDoc, UTAs, Online tutorials/examples

Main class file: Main.java

Data (non Java) files needed: Boss.java, ContinuationScreen.java, Enemy.java, Game.java, GameLevelTwo.java, Projectile.java, SplashScreen.java, WinningScreen.java

How to play the game: Use arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right. Use spacebar to shoot projectiles at the windows users/boss. The goal is for the user (Clippy) to reach a score of 2000 to advance to the 2nd level. After obtaining a score of 3000, Clippy will face the boss (Mac user), where Clippy will have to beat the boss 3 times to win the game.

Keys/Mouse input: Key Input described above (up, down, left, right, space) and used for cheat keys described below. 

Cheat Keys: H: Reset Clippy's health back to 100 (Levels 1 and 2)
            D: Set Clippy's health to 0(Levels 1 and 2)
            S: Increase score by 500 (Levels 1 and 2)
            E: Set Boss's health to 0 (Level 2)

Known bugs: There doesn't seem to be a bug in the game itself, but the code can be refactored to improve the efficiency/design. 

Extra features:

Impressions/Suggestions: Overall, I thought this project definitely allowed me to become more familiar with JavaFX and its objects. It did take a long time to complete, but I hope that it will help me in the future with the subsequent projects in class. Overall, it was a good project and will hopefully be worth it for the other peojcts. I definitely am more knowledgable about the objects in JavaFX.
